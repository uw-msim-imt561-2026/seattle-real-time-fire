## Context
This dataset captures real-time 911 fire and emergency incidents handled by the Seattle Fire Department during 2025. 
Each record represents a single dispatched incident and includes basic information about when the call occurred, 
the type of emergency, and where it happened. The data reflects real operational demand placed on fire/emergency 
services across the city and provides a reliable snapshot of emergency activity over time and location.

The context of this dataset and analysis is to better understand when, where, and why emergency incidents occur in Seattle. Key questions include:
1) How does call volume change by time of day, day of week, or season?
2) Which areas of the city consistently generate higher volumes of incidents? And are there certain locations/attributes associated with specific types of emergencies?
3) Are there noticeable trends in emergency types over time that could inform resource allocation or public safety planning?
